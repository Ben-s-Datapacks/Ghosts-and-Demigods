Currently this datapack that allows you to achieve this status is only available to the Noobs Play Minecraft SMP made by Ben2445Fun. Perhaps someday this datapack will become available to the public, but today is not that day. Then again, I probably won't update this text when I do make the datapack public. For now, enjoy being able to enter creative mode and whatnot. Maybe you've earned it; maybe you haven't; I'll never know."}]
